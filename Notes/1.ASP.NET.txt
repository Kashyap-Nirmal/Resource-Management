ASP.NET:

->ASP.NET runs under IIS(Microsoft Internet Information Servsices).

->Listbox:
-List box has SelectedItem property set to null and SelectedIndex property set to -1 when
nothing is selected.So we supposed to check to avoid the exception.
-In Multiple SelectionMode it will show the first selected item only.So we are supposed to 
use a loop.
